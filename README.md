# pym-img

A pure frontend image compression tool built with Angular

## Who is Pym?

Hank Pym is a scientist in Marvel Comics who discovered Pym Particles, allowing objects to change size. This made him Ant-Man, capable of shrinking to the size of an ant. Inspired by Hank Pym, this project aims to efficiently compress image sizes.
